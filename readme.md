### Download Link
[Brackets](http://brackets.io/ "Brackets")

### Pros :smiley:

1. Built-in browser live-updating
2. ***Brackets*** will automatically refresh the browser and load the latest saved version of a file open in the browser. This works with php as well. 
3. Editing a css will even highlight the tag that's currently being worked on. However, it only works with Chrome.
4. Brackets is easy on memory usage and it starts up quickly.
5. Brackets supports drag and drop of text, as well as multi / rectangular selection.


### Cons :disappointed:

* Problematic updater
Though the website says there is an update available, the updater in Brackets may give you an error, resulting in you having to download updates manually.

* Supports only web languages by default
Brackets is built for web development and that's where it excels at out of the box. Other languages that have a CodeMirror mode can be added as well (and language support plugins can be added).

* Some gaps have to be filled by plugins, while these features should be built in.
   For example: Jump to matching brace (bracket / parenthesis)  
   Gutter selection of lines  
   Recall previous searches / replacements  
   Autofill of search field with text under caret (text has to be selected)  
   Show whitespace / end of lines / indentation guides / right margin  
   Selection to upper / lower case

### Bracket vs Visual Studio Code vs Atom

| Brackets      | Visual Studio Code          | Atom  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Simple               | Complex | Simple |
| Live Preview Function    | Intelli-sense      |  Auto Completion |


### Code Block

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">  
document.write("Brackets is compatible with JavaScript");  
</script>  
```

### Number one reason for using brackets

 * [x] Simple

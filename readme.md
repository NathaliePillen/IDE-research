Brackets pros {

Built-in browser live-updating
Brackets will automatically refresh the browser and load the latest saved version of a file open in the browser. This works with php as well. 
Editing a css will even highlight the tag that's currently being worked on. However, it only works with Chrome.

- Lightweight
Brackets is easy on memory usage and it starts up quickly.


- Drag and drop support
Brackets supports drag and drop of text, as well as multi / rectangular selection.

Cons {

- Problematic updater
Though the website says there is an update available, the updater in Brackets may give you an error, resulting in you having to download updates manually.

- Supports only web languages by default <but>
Brackets is built for web development and that's where it excels at out of the box. Other languages that have a CodeMirror mode can be added as well.
<and language support plugins can be added>

- Some gaps have to be filled by plugins, while these features should be built in.
For example:

Jump to matching brace (bracket / parenthesis);
Gutter selection of lines;
Recall previous searches / replacements;
Autofill of search field with text under caret (text has to be selected);
Show whitespace / end of lines / indentation guides / right margin;
Selection to upper / lower case;
and some more.
